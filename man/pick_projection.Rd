\title{Choose the most appropriate DuckDB view/table for filtering}
\usage{
pick_projection(con, data_type, feature_name = "uuid")
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{DuckDB connection object of class 'duckdb_connection'. This
connection contains the views/tables to select from.}

\item{data_type}{Single string: value found in the data_type' column of
output_file_types() and also as the name of a view found in
DBI::dbListTables(con), indicating which view to collect data from.}

\item{feature_name}{Single string: the name of the feature that the file is
intended to be filtered by. Default = "uuid"}
}
\value{
Single string: the name of a DuckDB view/table
}
\description{
'pick_projection' takes a data type and the name of a feature
to filter that data by and chooses the appropriate DuckDB view/table for
performing that filtering in an efficient way. If no view is tailored to the
specific feature, a view/table sorted by UUID will be the default.
