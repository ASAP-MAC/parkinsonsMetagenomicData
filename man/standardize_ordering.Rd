\title{Standardize the order of a vector of delimited strings}
\usage{
standardize_ordering(vec, delim)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec}{Vector of strings: vector of strings to be standardized}

\item{delim}{Character: delimiter to split each of the strings by.}
}
\value{
Vector of strings
}
\description{
'standardize_ordering' takes a vector of strings, splits each of
them on a specified delimiter, orders them, then re-collapses them with the
same delimiter. This confirms that when calling unique(), there are no
strings that contain the same elements but in a different order.
