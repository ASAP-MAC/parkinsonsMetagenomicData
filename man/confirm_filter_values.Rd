\title{Validate 'filter_values' argument}
\usage{
confirm_filter_values(filter_values, available_features = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filter_values}{Named list: input to be validated}

\item{available_features}{Character vector: features that the list element
names should be found in. Default: NULL}
}
\description{
'confirm_filter_values' checks that a named list is valide to be
used as a 'filter_values' argument for various functions in
parkinsonsMetagenomicData. Specifically, the input should be a named list,
where the element name equals the name of a column to be
filtered and element value equals a vector of exact column values. Base usage
of 'confirm_filter_values' just confirms that the object is a named list, and
if any of the elements are named 'uuid', validates that the values of that
element are valid uuids. If a vector of available features is provided, the
names of the elements of the list will be compared to that vector.
}
\details{
This function is intended to be used within another function as
input validation. If the input is valid, nothing will happen. If it is not,
the function will throw a 'stop()' error.
