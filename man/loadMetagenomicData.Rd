\title{Load cached files into R as a merged TreeSummarizedExperiment object}
\usage{
loadMetagenomicData(cache_table)
}
\arguments{
\item{cache_table}{A data.frame or tibble: structured like
cacheMetagenomicData() output; contains the columns 'uuid', 'cache_path', and
'data_type', with appropriate entries for each file to be loaded in.}
}
\value{
A TreeSummarizedExperiment object with relevant sample metadata
attached as colData.
}
\description{
'loadMetagenomicData' takes a table of information about cached
files, including paths to the cached files as well as associated UUIDs and
data types, and loads the files into R as TreeSummarizedExperiment objects.
Associated sample metadata is automatically attached as colData, and the
objects are merged into a single TreeSummarizedExperiment object.
}
\details{
At the moment, only the \code{metaphlan_lists} data types,
\code{viral_clusters} and \code{relative_abundance}, as well as the \code{humann} data
types, have parsing functions for automatically loading into
TreeSummarizedExperiment objects.
